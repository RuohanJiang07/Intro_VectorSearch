After a decade as a Vice President at Walt Disney Studios, Rod moved to New York to attend Parsons School of Design. In 2003, Rod Winterrowd Inc. opened its New York City office on 5th Avenue. Principal Rod Winterrowd describes his style as ‚Äòtailored, crisp, contemporary, yet steeped in classism. It is based on a contemporary interpretation of the formalist architectural principles and tenets of order and balance. We work with clients to create beautiful, classic interiors, for both new construction and remodels of existing properties‚Äù.

My philosophy is based on the following principles:
	‚Ä¢	To offer superior service.
	‚Ä¢	To begin each new project with a strategic plan that adheres to order, discipline, and organization, resulting in a project that is on time, on budget, and beautifully executed.
	‚Ä¢	To foster a relationship between client and designer that translates into a home complimenting the taste and lifestyle of the client, not the designer.¬†
	‚Ä¢	To operate in an atmosphere that fosters goodwill, teamwork, and collaboration among employees.
	‚Ä¢	To recognize that all of our clients expect and deserve the highest levels of discretion.

What I can help you with :

-Floor plan layout 
-My favorite showrooms &amp; stores
-Window treatments
-Finishes, paint selections
-Fabrics &amp; wallpapers
-Editing &amp; restyling 
-How to organize your start effectively‚Ä¶. and so much more.

Believe it or not, this is what I love doing. Of course, the big projects are always alluring, but this is lots of fun and brings me a great deal of joy.

üëëComment MASTERCLASS to sign up!!

I am here to teach you how I‚Äôve used astrology for making nearly half a million dollars over the last 4 years: the sales skills, business acumen and how the language of astrology has changed the way I have clarity/confidence, manifest ideal clients, grow my socials, fill my events, get my messaging and branding on point, and importantly, feel SO aligned and on purpose with my mission. 

It was all by using these secrets that we‚Äôll unlock in your chart together. 

If you are a purpose-driven entrepreneur, this reading is for you. 

We‚Äôll be going into SO much. But here‚Äôs a little of my cred in case you don‚Äôt know the background! 

Five years ago, I began syncing my work with Astrology and it changed everything for me:

üíé I was able generate $77,000 within my first ever launch.

üíé I booked 50 sales calls during that first launch and was able to work (aka ‚Äúclose‚Äù) with 90% of them. 

üíé I was the first employee + sales coach at a start up &amp; scaled their biz from 1 &gt; 3 million$ in sales that year.

üíé I sold out a magical retreat in Joshua Tree using transits and planetary gifts.

üíé When I look back at my 15 years of experience in working in various positions in sales: nightlife, events, marketing, entrepreneurship, I realized I was always living in alignment, but I could have taken advantage of it so much more.

More about my background:
************************
At Stripe, my team led or supported 200+ betas/launches every year, ensuring smooth experiences for users and user-facing employees.¬†We managed Stripe-wide process and information rails including the company‚Äôs process for surfacing top asks from users, launch calendar, and the launch readiness process that is key for compliance and IPO readiness. I led bi-weekly C-Suite meetings for two+ years, designed to ensure awareness of all key upcoming product launches, delays and risks.

At Uber, my team built the connective tissue between product teams and operations teams around the world. We were responsible for leveraging regional experts and 600+ city teams to surface and prioritize product insights, ensuring global viability of the products/features we were building, and managing the rollout and ongoing operations of those products. Prior to Product Ops, I led Uber‚Äôs driver devices program globally, managing across multiple functions with P&amp;L ownership. I regularly presented to the CEO and Head of Operations, and the team‚Äôs projects saved the company millions, better positioning for sustainable scaling.

Prior to Uber I led Product Management for a series C SaaS startup (acquired), and began my career in a leadership program with GE, accelerating my growth with stints in China and Europe.

&quot;Product operations is IMO very essential for a fast-scaling product &amp; business. One problem is that it&#x27;s defined differently everywhere. Product operations leaders like Blake Samic know what they are doing, so I am very bullish on the product operations role over the long term.‚Äù 
- Shreyas Doshi, PM industry thought leader

‚ÄúThe principal thing is following your users. No one really talks about how‚Ä¶ We have a very high performing, scaled Product Ops team‚Ä¶ aggregating the asks we get from all channels. The key part is closing the loop. In every product review we now have a top ten list of what users want, and we‚Äôre clear on what‚Äôs committed or uncommitted.‚Äù 
- CPO of Stripe

‚ÄúProduct Ops is Uber‚Äôs secret aorta. We have built the world‚Äôs fastest growing company through a strategy of radical decentralization - and by investing in the entrepreneurial hustle of Ops teams in cities around the world. Product Ops is the connective tissue that allows this strategy to thrive while we also build out the highly scalable ‚Äúheart‚Äù of our technology platform‚Äù

‚ÄúHey. First time distributed profits from my company after growing it for 8 years.

My share is $110k, Never saw so much money in my life. All started from your question: ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you make it profitable and hold it forever‚Äù when I told you I‚Äôm growing to sell it.

I didn‚Äôt hear you and kept going. We lost 30% of revenue and kept spending. Wasted over $1M on nothing and could have distributed it.

Never going back to this. All I care about now is to build a business that will generate cash for decades.‚Äù
